title:  Numbers. Client dashboard.
description: A client dashboard based on React. Developed in 24 hours.
description-long: This project was developed on our ShipIt Days. We created a generic dashboard for one of our clients including real data charts. It was completely based on React and Webpack. We scribbled the concept and built the UX / UI from scratch.
description-long-additional: The ShipIt Days are an internal team event. You have 24 hours to find, develop and present your own project.
