    <h4>About the project</h4>
    <p>
        Early 2016 I got the opportunity to develop the new Carnival Cruise Line website from scratch. The main task was to create a fully responsive website including the booking process.
    </p>
    <p>
        Finally we created a framework which is currently used by some other cruise lines like princesscruises.de and cunardline.ch. This project was completely processed by Scandio.
