    <h4>About the project</h4>
    <p>
        Early 2016 I got the opportunity to develop the new Carnival Cruise Line website from scratch. The main task was to create a fully responsive website including the booking process.
    </p>
    <p>
        This framework is currently used by some other cruise lines like Princess Cruises or Cunard Line. This project was completely processed with Scandio.
