<div class="content-article-project">
 
<p>We built our first <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/1059348-Theme-Website" target="_blank" title="Our first Confluence dashboard">dashboard</a> in early 2013 and through the years it became to an important page for colleagues to get a fast view whats happening around. Based on the last years experience we started developing Lively in late 2016. Lively supports some of the most popular Atlassian add-ons like team calendar, questions and blogs.</p>

<p>It will be ready for download at the end of February 2017.</p>
