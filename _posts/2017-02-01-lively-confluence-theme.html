    <h4>About the project</h4>
    <p>We built our first dashboard in early 2013 at Scandio and through the years it became to an important landingpage for colleagues to get a fast view whats happening around them. Based on the last years experience we started developing Lively in late 2016. Lively supports some of the most popular Atlassian add-ons like team calendar, questions and blogs.</p>

    <p>This add-on will be ready for download on the Atlassian Marketplace in March 2017.</p>
