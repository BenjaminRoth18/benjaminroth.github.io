        <h4>About the project</h4>
        <p>
            The Confluence dashboard became to an important landing page for everyone in our company. Based on the last years experience we started developing Lively Theme in late 2016.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lively Theme is an Atlassian Confluence add-on which provides a modern widget based dashboard including an extended space navigation. The first version will be ready for download on the Atlassian Marketplace in March 2017.
        </p>

        <h4>Atlassian dashboards since 2013</h4>
        <p>
            We built our first dashboard in early 2013 to use it as an informal landing page for the whole team. Over the years it became to an important dashboard for other companies to brand it with their CI and extend it with their own widgets and ideas.
        </p>

        <p>
            The main goal was to develop a structered dashboard which can easily be extended and used as an intranet including multiple color options.

        <h4>A theme for everyone</h4>
        <p>
            Based on the last experience we decided to develop a new dashboard which is compatible with Confluence 6. After several standups and discussions we started to create the first sketches and mockups and finally the dashboard interface.
        </p>
        <p class="space-bottom-large">
            After a clear vision what we will deliver in the first version and where Lively Theme will take place in the upcoming months we finished our first package and started to create the interface as well as the prototype.
